About
============

Choice Coin is an Algorand Standard Asset that powers Decentralized Decisions, a voting and governance software built directly on the Algorand Blockchain. Decentralized Decisions enables organizations to make governance decisions in an open and decentralized manner. For the Choice Coin DAO, Decentralized Decisions leverages Proof-of-Participation as a governance mechanism, allowing voters to have a larger say in direct proportion to their contribution to the network.

Research
============

This includes [WhitePapers](https://github.com/ChoiceCoin/White_Paper), [Decentralized decisions](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3913316) and [Smart contracts](https://vixra.org/abs/2107.0097)

These research papers dive into Decentralized Decisons, a governance mechanism that leverages Choice Coin and the Fortior Voting Protocol to allow organizations to vote in a decentralized manner.

The Choice Coin White-Paper describes Choice Coin, a new Algorand-Standard-Asset that faciliates democracy and voting. An open-source endeavour, the Choice Coin White-Paper was made possible thanks to the efforts of the Algorand and Choice Coin Community.

The smart contract research paper is the first of a few that will explain in detail our work and deveopment. It introduces a new of type of smart-contract (Algogenous Smart Contracts) and also references Choice Coin. The official Choice Coin white-paper will go into more detail. more [details](https://github.com/ChoiceCoin/Smart_Contracts);
